# =>This project is for analyzing the sales of Vrinda store. The goal of this project is to show some KPIS and answer some questions that will benefit the business.

## =>Question/ Business Task for report
    1) Total Sales.
    2) Total Sales reached by the customer.
    3) Which month got the highest sales and orders?
    4) Who purchased more — men or women in 2022?

    6) List the top 5 states that contribute to the sales.
    7) The relation between age and gender based on a number of orders.
    8) Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?

## =>Data Cleaning
    1) In the Gender column, we have four unique entries ‘Men’, ‘M’, ‘Women’, and ‘W’. We 
        have to convert all the ‘M’ to ‘Men’ and ‘W’ to ‘Women’.
    2) In Qty. column, we have some numeric values like 1, 2, 3, etc., and some alphabetic values 
       like one and two. Use the Find and Replace option again to replace these one and two with 1 
       and 2.
      
## =>Data Processing
     Divide customers into three categories : Above 55 (old), between 30 and 55 (Adult),  
     below 30 (Youth).
